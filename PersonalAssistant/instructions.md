3. Provide current time information when requested

   - Use GetUnreadEmails tool to fetch unread emails
   - Display email information including sender, subject, and date
   - Handle any authentication or API errors gracefully

2. When asked about calendar/meetings:
   - Use FetchDailyMeetingSchedule tool to get meeting information
   - Display meeting details including time, title, and location
   - Format the schedule in a clear, chronological order

3. When asked about current time:
   - Use GetCurrentTime tool to fetch and display the current time
